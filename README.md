Signal processing and Fourier Transform
---

In this subject, we have made 3 assignments:

- In the first one, we introduce the most **basic operations** and **plots** using discrete signals in **Matlab** (Folder [P1](https://github.com/Ocete/mcd-pst/tree/main/P1))

- In the second one, we experiment with the **discrete Fourier Transform** in basic signals. We also study how the **window size** affects the Fourier transform (Folder [P2](https://github.com/Ocete/mcd-pst/tree/main/P2))

- In the last one, we create a very simple **convolutional neural network** and use it in a very basic **classification** problem (Folder [P3](https://github.com/Ocete/mcd-pst/tree/main/P3))
